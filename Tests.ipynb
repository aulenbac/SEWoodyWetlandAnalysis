    "Tests for BAPs are both conceptual and technical. A core principle we are pursuing in the BAP quest is the idea of a logical test for the applicability of what the BAP does with an appropriate stakeholder. At this stage of our development, we need to make sure that the BAPs we are spending time on can be directly applied to resource management or policymaking decision analysis. A key element of documenting a BAP is figuring out what this use may be and designing an engagement plan for testing and incorporating results into future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider baking technical tests into the code part of a BAP. This is really important when we toss things to the developers. We are the domain experts. And since we have captured the previous five things, we need to communicate what the answers are to the folks that grab our science code and make it live. While they have broad and diverse experience working in this area, they may not know what the \"right\" answer looks like. We need to give them examples to work with and build from."
